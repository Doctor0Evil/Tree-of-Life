# BEAST/PLAGUE Diagnostic Safety Doctrine (Doc Crate)

This crate encodes the BEAST/PLAGUE diagnostic-only doctrine for the Tree-of-Life / Tree-of-FEAR stack as:

- A stable, human-readable spec (this file).
- A set of Rust types and invariants that can be imported into tests and CI.
- Helper checks that fail builds when internal crates violate the doctrine.

## Scope

1. Roles and invariants (diagnostic vs actuator)
2. RoH/DECAY/UNFAIRDRAIN biosafe polytope
3. FateWindow lifecycle
4. BEAST kernel interface contract
5. Googolswarm proof-of-ownership and audit rails

- Biosafe Polytopes to Moral Ledgers: Neuromorphic Safety Framework.
- Tree-of-FEAR Schema: Neuromorphic Neuro-Consent Validation.
- Jetson-Line Ethical Neuromorphic Research Plan.
- MicroSociety Simulation Framework (reflection + Rust code).
