Tree-of-Life fits cleanly as an educational, non-actuating “energy budget” and fairness layer on top of your existing NewRow-Print!/BiophysicalEnvelopeSpec stack, using BLOOD, OXYGEN, WAVE, H20, TIME, DECAY, LIFEFORCE, BRAIN, SMART, EVOLVE, POWER, TECH, FEAR, PAIN, NANO as biophysical-logic assets while still respecting RoH, neurorights, and safest-first governance.

## 1. What Tree-of-Life adds

- Treats each asset (BLOOD, OXYGEN, etc.) as a scalar or index bound to existing envelope axes (HR/HRV, EDA, EEG, motion), so nothing new is “freehand” or hypothetical. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/0d964317-c2c3-400a-81f6-f923ea23fc71/if-necessary-sanitize-the-code-7jDmbRJlT3SnSttCB78ZQg.md)
- Provides a didactic layer: every neuromorphic pattern is evaluated in terms of how it distributes these assets, but the only outputs are labels, scores, and logs, not actuation or rewards. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/c1dfc1db-5c76-4eeb-a0c0-9004d38f6968/newrow-print-I_myn4yfSA6t9spUFtJA4w.md)
- Remains deviceless and simulation‑first: Tree-of-Life lives in CapModelOnly/CapLabBench, never opens a new path to CapControlledHuman beyond what the BiophysicalEnvelope and CapabilityState lattice already allow. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/c1dfc1db-5c76-4eeb-a0c0-9004d38f6968/newrow-print-I_myn4yfSA6t9spUFtJA4w.md)

### Asset → envelope alignment (illustrative, non-reward)

- BLOOD, OXYGEN → HR, HRV, possibly future SpO2-like streams (if present) mapped through existing RangeSpec. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/0d964317-c2c3-400a-81f6-f923ea23fc71/if-necessary-sanitize-the-code-7jDmbRJlT3SnSttCB78ZQg.md)
- WAVE → EEG bandpower and alpha-envelope CVE axes you already defined. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/0d964317-c2c3-400a-81f6-f923ea23fc71/if-necessary-sanitize-the-code-7jDmbRJlT3SnSttCB78ZQg.md)
- H20 → hydration or slow-acting metabolic proxies (if you later add them as axes); currently can be a neutral, “not configured” placeholder.  
- TIME, DECAY → epoch counters, cooldownsecsmin, and RoH trajectory over time. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/0d964317-c2c3-400a-81f6-f923ea23fc71/if-necessary-sanitize-the-code-7jDmbRJlT3SnSttCB78ZQg.md)
- LIFEFORCE → RoH global ceiling (0.30) plus neurorights shards; Tree-of-Life can only read that budget, never raise it. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/c1dfc1db-5c76-4eeb-a0c0-9004d38f6968/newrow-print-I_myn4yfSA6t9spUFtJA4w.md)
- BRAIN, SMART, EVOLVE → capability state and evidence bundles (balancestabilityreport, CAPMODELONLY→CAPLABBENCH→CAPCONTROLLEDHUMAN). [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/ffd9f58d-80f1-4530-a278-878b851352a6/a-foundational-report-on-neura-kVDayD8JSie4.ukpYI37WA.md)
- POWER, TECH → which modules are active and at what intensity, still constrained by POLICY_STACK and .neuro-cap.aln tiers. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/c1dfc1db-5c76-4eeb-a0c0-9004d38f6968/newrow-print-I_myn4yfSA6t9spUFtJA4w.md)
- FEAR, PAIN → combinations of EDA, HR/HRV, motion/gaze patterns that cross WARN/RISK bands in specific axes. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/ffd9f58d-80f1-4530-a278-878b851352a6/a-foundational-report-on-neura-kVDayD8JSie4.ukpYI37WA.md)
- NANO → how many discrete events are written to donutloop/evolve (granularity of logged changes, not any physical nanotech). [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/c1dfc1db-5c76-4eeb-a0c0-9004d38f6968/newrow-print-I_myn4yfSA6t9spUFtJA4w.md)

## 2. Fairness and “no one can overpower” guarantees

Tree-of-Life can be framed as a **read-only fairness oracle** that observes the policy engine; it never grants or revokes rights or capabilities. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/c1dfc1db-5c76-4eeb-a0c0-9004d38f6968/newrow-print-I_myn4yfSA6t9spUFtJA4w.md)

- It reads CapabilityState, consent states, RoH, and envelope outputs (INFO/WARN/RISK) and computes fairness views like “no subject’s TREE assets are drained faster than others under similar conditions,” but only as metrics. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/ffd9f58d-80f1-4530-a278-878b851352a6/a-foundational-report-on-neura-kVDayD8JSie4.ukpYI37WA.md)
- Any attempt to use TREE scores to auto‑elevate access_grant or bypass envelopes would be blocked by the same CapabilityGuard, ReversalConditions, and .stake.aln invariants you already enforce. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/0d964317-c2c3-400a-81f6-f923ea23fc71/if-necessary-sanitize-the-code-7jDmbRJlT3SnSttCB78ZQg.md)
- Unknown thresholds (e.g., new mappings from WAVE or NANO) stay in CapModelOnly with simulation‑only outputs until backed by data and encoded as proper BiophysicalEnvelope axes; Tree-of-Life must treat them as “unknown, cannot decide.” [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/ffd9f58d-80f1-4530-a278-878b851352a6/a-foundational-report-on-neura-kVDayD8JSie4.ukpYI37WA.md)

## 3. Learning and scaling safely with AI

Tree-of-Life can “learn” in the same way the rest of NewRow-Print! learns: via new ALN shards and Rust modules that go through .evolve.jsonl, RoH, neurorights, and CapabilityGuard. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/c1dfc1db-5c76-4eeb-a0c0-9004d38f6968/newrow-print-I_myn4yfSA6t9spUFtJA4w.md)

- Patterns similar to existing safe ones (e.g., new combinations of BLOOD+WAVE mapped to known HR+EEG envelopes) can be explored freely in CapModelOnly with no live coupling. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/ffd9f58d-80f1-4530-a278-878b851352a6/a-foundational-report-on-neura-kVDayD8JSie4.ukpYI37WA.md)
- Any proposal to let Tree-of-Life influence real-time decisions at CapControlledHuman must carry evidence bundles and stay inside BiophysicalEnvelopeSpec rohceiling and neurorights limits, and still cannot override OwnerDecision or ReversalConditions. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/0d964317-c2c3-400a-81f6-f923ea23fc71/if-necessary-sanitize-the-code-7jDmbRJlT3SnSttCB78ZQg.md)
- Eco-net/evolution rewards remain out-of-scope: Tree-of-Life shards must explicitly be tagged as education-only and never feed into token, score, or selection mechanisms that could be interpreted as incentives. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/c1dfc1db-5c76-4eeb-a0c0-9004d38f6968/newrow-print-I_myn4yfSA6t9spUFtJA4w.md)

## 4. Suggested research-object for next turns

Given your description, a precise next research-object is:

> A non-actuating TreeOfLifeView ALN/Rust layer that maps envelope outputs and RoH into the 14 TREE assets, producing only educational labels, fairness diagnostics, and audit logs, with no paths into CapabilityState, consent, or rewards.

Future turns can then focus on:

- Defining a TreeOfLifeView schema (SECTION/ROW style) that references existing BiophysicalEnvelopeSpec and RoH axes, but adds no new control. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/ffd9f58d-80f1-4530-a278-878b851352a6/a-foundational-report-on-neura-kVDayD8JSie4.ukpYI37WA.md)
- Specifying fairness predicates (e.g., per-role/per-subject limits on TREE asset drift) as pure checks that can never escalate privileges. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/c1dfc1db-5c76-4eeb-a0c0-9004d38f6968/newrow-print-I_myn4yfSA6t9spUFtJA4w.md)
- Finally, compiling that into one Rust module that plugs into the existing policy engine as an observer-only diagnostics surface, consistent with NR-SAFE-0001 and your non-fiction, executable requirements. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/0d964317-c2c3-400a-81f6-f923ea23fc71/if-necessary-sanitize-the-code-7jDmbRJlT3SnSttCB78ZQg.md)
